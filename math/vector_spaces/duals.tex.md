[Wikipedia - Dual Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space)

> Any vector space V has a corresponding dual vector space (or just dual space for short) consisting of all linear functionals on V, together with the vector space structure of pointwise addition and scalar multiplication by constants.

[Wikipedia - Linear Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_form)

> A linear functional or linear form (also called a one-form or covector) is a linear map from a vector space to its field of scalars.

[Wikipedia - Linear Functionals - ("Interesting properties")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_form#Properties)
> * Any linear functional L is either trivial (equal to 0 everywhere) or surjective onto the scalar field.  Indeed, this follows since just as the image of a vector subspace under a linear transformation is a subspace, so is the image of V under L.  however, the only subspaces (i.e., k-subspaces) of k are {0} and k itself.

> * A linear functional is continuous if and only if its kernel is closed.
> * Linear functionals with the same kernel are proportional.

## Questions

1. What is the relationship between Duals & linear functionals ?
2. Why need linear functionals ?
3. So is the impression of the Dual being somewhat of an "inverse" wrong ?
4. What are the use cases or purposes of Duals ?
5. Is this actually the whole definition of what they are ?
5.1 Why all linear functionals ?  
5.2 Whay linear ? Is it because of vector spaces ?

6. So is the Dual Space kind of like a vector space on the "field" of all linear functionals of the original vector space ?

7. What is the difference between an *Algebraic Dual Space* and a *Continous Dual Space* ?

8. How? This kind of seems magical or impossible/hard.  
8.1. Is it dependent on a specific bilinear form or something ?

    >The set of all linear functionals from V to k, Homk(V,k), forms a vector space over k with the addition of the operations of addition and scalar multiplication (defined pointwise).

9. How and why is this usefull ?

10. This could be the connection between the Transpose & the dual space

11. Are these (^) all the linear functionals though ?  
11.1 Can probably compose these with the scalar ones, but does that count?  
11.2 Ex: Can different bilinear forms lead to functionals that can't be represented in this way ?
